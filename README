== PES-XA05-CSV
Combat simulation visualization
Version: 0.9.0

Author: Vratislav Kalenda <v.kalenda+csv@gmail.com> (C) 2010
Showcase strategy by: Jakub Kohout
Original PES-XA05 source files by: Tomas Holas (Unicorn College)

Written in Ruby 1.9.2-p0 (Seems to work in JRuby 1.5)

This visualization should make writing the PES-XA05 homework a little bit more fun.

Only thing you need to do is implement your own strategy, and pass it to the armies in the main.rb.
ALWAYS TEST YOUR STRATEGIES AGAINST THE ORIGINAL PES-XA05! THERE MAY BE BUGS IN THE VISUALIZATION.

These files should be interesting to you:
main.rb - you run this to begin the simulation
generator.rb - you run and modify this to get different armies for the simulation
install.rb - checks for the necessary libraries and installs them if necesary.

We tried to keep the original simulation logic unchanged but there are two changes that you should know about:
- The maximum unit starting distance from the center of the battlefield was lowered from 95 to 20.
This makes the simulation a lot nicer to look at.

- The tank range was lowered from 20 to 10 to compensate for the smaller battlefield and also to balance things out a little bit.
