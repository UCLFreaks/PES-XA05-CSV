Original PES-XA05 source files by: Tomas Holas (Unicorn College)

Written in Ruby 1.9.2-p0 (Seems to work in Ruby 1.8 and JRuby 1.5)

Instalation:
On windows:
1) Run install.rb - that should be all, you need to do.

On linux:
1) Install the necessary libraries. See http://rubygame.org/wiki/Linux_Installation_Guide for help.
2) Run install.rb


This visualization should make writing the PES-XA05 homework a little bit more fun.

Only thing you need to do is implement your own strategy, and pass it to the armies in the main.rb.
ALWAYS TEST YOUR STRATEGIES AGAINST THE simulation_only.rb! THERE MAY BE BUGS IN THE VISUALIZATION.

These files should be interesting to you:
main.rb - you run this to begin the simulation
generator.rb - you run and modify this to get different armies for the simulation
install.rb - checks for the necessary libraries and installs them if necesary.

We tried to keep the original simulation logic unchanged but there are two changes that you should know about:
- The maximum unit starting distance from the center of the battlefield was lowered from 95 to 20.
This makes the simulation a lot nicer to look at.
This setting can be changed in generator.rb

- Unit count has been halved to better fit into the smaller battlefield.
This setting can be changed in generator.rb

- The tank range was lowered from 20 to 10 to compensate for the smaller battlefield and also to balance things out a little bit.


TODO LIST:
- Visually distinguish between normal soldier, elite and captain.
- Win message.
- Decay of the dead bodies
